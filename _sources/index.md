# Machine Learning

## Course Description

- **Course number:** COMSC 335
- **Semester:** Spring 2026

Machine learning is the study of creating programs that can learn through experience, and has become a powerful and pervasive paradigm in technology, science, and society. In this course, we will explore the mathematical foundations, models, and practices that enable machine learning. Students will get hands-on experience understanding, building, and evaluating machine learning models using modern scientific computing frameworks coding in Python. This course is programming intensive and will have a subsantial mathematical component. 

### Prerequisites

- COMSC 205: Data Structures
- MATH 232: Discrete Math
- A calculus course (MATH 101, 102, or 203)
- Comfort in or a willingness to learn Python
